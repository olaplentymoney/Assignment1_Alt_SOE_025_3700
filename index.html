      </p>
      <h3>Laying the Foundation: My Background</h3>
      <p>
        I started my academic journey with a degree in Project Management
        Technology, which laid a solid foundation in planning, strategy, and
        execution. Later, I pursued an MSc in Information Technology at the
        University of Lagos, deepening my understanding of computing systems, IT
        governance, and digital innovation. These academic experiences were not
        just about acquiring certificates — they were opportunities to think
        critically, solve real problems, and understand how technology is used
        to power everything from corporate systems to global economies. Today, I
        work as a Settlement and Reconciliation Officer at Union Bank of
        Nigeria, a role that demands attention to detail, deep analytical
        thinking, and a solid grasp of data workflows. In this position, I

        resolve discrepancies, and automate reporting processes using tools like
        Excel, VBA, and Power Query.
      </p>
      <h3>The Gap Between Operations and Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        While I’ve grown professionally in operations and analytics, I’ve become
        increasingly aware of the invisible architecture behind everything I do
        — APIs, databases, automation scripts, and backend infrastructure. I
        began asking questions: How are financial systems built under the hood?
        How does a payment gateway communicate with a bank’s ledger? What does
        it take to build secure, scalable platforms from the backend up? These
        questions were more than curiosity. They revealed a gap between my
        operational role and the engineering principles that drive real impact.
        I realized that if I truly wanted to build, improve, and own digital
        solutions — not just operate them — I needed to pivot into backend
        engineering.
